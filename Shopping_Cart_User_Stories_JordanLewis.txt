Shopping Cart User Stories


1) As a user, I want to be able to see a list of products I've added 
to my cart with a total so that I can have an idea of how much I will be spending on
my purchase after tax and shipping costs.

2) As a user, I want to be able to increase the quantity of an already added product 
to my cart so that I can take advantage of it's sale price.

3) As a user, I want to be able to delete an item I added to my cart so that I can reduce 
the total of my purchase.

4) As a user, I want to be able to enter a promo code that I received so that I can get a 
discount on my order.

5) As a user, I want to be able to log in to my member account at checkout so that I 
don't have to manually type in all of my customer info.
